The addtional data are:

RNAseq_quantification.txt: The first colum contains the Ensembl gene id and the second column contains the HGNC gene id. The remaining colums represent the expression values for the listed cell lines.

RNAseq_call.txt: In addition to estimating expression values, the expression status of the gene model was also calculated, where a binary call (1 or 0) was made if the Ensembl gene model was detected above the background noise level.  As with the previous file, the first colum contains the Ensembl gene id and the second column contains the HGNC gene id. The remaining colums represent the expression status calls for the listed cell lines.

CNV.txt: The datafile is a tab-delimited text file that contains a gene by cell line matrix of gene level copy number quantification. The first column in the file is an Entrez ID and the second column is the HGNC id.The remaining columns are individual cell lines.

In all above text files:
Drug sensitivity data is from 2nd to 6th rows. First column is the drug name and from 3rd column on are the -log transformed GI50 values. A 'NA' means the value is missing.
